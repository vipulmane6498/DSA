Pattern Searching in C#: 
// This code performs pattern searching in a string. It checks for all occurrences of a pattern in a given string and prints the starting index of each occurrence.

Approach:

1. Inputs:
  a. first: The main string
  b. second: The pattern to search

2. Loop through first:
  a. For each index i, check if second matches first starting from i.

3. Inner comparison:
  a. Compare characters of second with substring in first.
  b. Break if any character doesnâ€™t match.

4. If full match (j == n):
  a. Print the starting index i.

5. Output:
  a. All starting indices where the pattern is found.

If full match (j == n):

Print the starting index i.

Output:

All starting indices where the pattern is found.
